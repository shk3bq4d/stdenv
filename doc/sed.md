sed -n -e '/TERMINATE/,$p' # will print the line matching TERMINATE till the end of the file: Explained: -n disables default behavior of sed of printing each line after executing its script on it, -e indicated a script to sed, /TERMINATE/,$ is an address (line) range selection meaning the first line matching the TERMINATE regular expression (like grep) to the end of the file ($), and p is the print command which prints the current line.



sed -e '1,/TERMINATE/d' #will print from the following line matching TERMINATE till the end of the file: Explained: 1,/TERMINATE/ is an address (line) range selection meaning the first line for the input to the 1st line matching the TERMINATE regular expression, and d is the delete command which delete the current line and skip to the next line. As sed default behavior is to print the lines, it will print the lines after TERMINATE to the end of input.



sed -e '/TERMINATE/,$d' # the lines before TERMINATE:


sed -e '1,/TERMINATE/w before
/TERMINATE/,$w after' file # if you want both lines before and after TERMINATE in 2 different files in a single pass:

The before and after files will contain the line with terminate, so to process each you need to use:

head -n -1 before
tail -n +2 after

Edit2:

IF you do not want to hard-code the filenames in the sed script, you can:

before=before.txt
after=after.txt
sed -e "1,/TERMINATE/w $before
/TERMINATE/,\$w $after" file

But then you have to escape the $ meaning the last line so the shell will not try to expand the $w variable (note that we now use double quotes around the script instead of single quotes).

I forgot to tell that the new line is important after the filenames in the script so that sed knows that the filenames end.

After matching /^Paco/ we read into the pattern buffer until s// succeeds (or EOF: the pattern buffer will be printed unchanged). Then we start over searching for /^Paco/.

Flip screen

Applications such as editors and file viewers normally use a terminal feature called the alternate screen, which is a second screen buffer without scrollback. When they exit, they switch back to the primary screen to restore the command line as it was before invoking the application.
The Flip Screen menu command and Alt+F12 shortcut allow looking at the primary screen while the alternate screen is active, and vice versa. For example, this allows to refer to past commands while editing a file.

Switching session

The Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab shortcuts can be used to switch between mintty windows. Minimised windows are skipped.

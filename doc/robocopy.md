robocopy <source> <destination> [<file>[ ...]] [<options>]
Parameter	Description
<source>	Specifies the path to the source directory.
<destination>	Specifies the path to the destination directory.
<file>	Specifies the file or files to be copied. Wildcard characters (* or ?) are supported. If you don't specify this parameter, *.* is used as the default value.
<options>	Specifies the options to use with the robocopy command, including copy, file, retry, logging, and job options.
Copy options
Option	Description
/s	Copies subdirectories. This option automatically excludes empty directories.
/e	Copies subdirectories. This option automatically includes empty directories.
/lev:<n>	Copies only the top n levels of the source directory tree.
/z	Copies files in restartable mode. In restartable mode, should a file copy be interrupted, Robocopy can pick up where it left off rather than recopying the entire file.
/b	Copies files in backup mode. Backup mode allows Robocopy to override file and folder permission settings (ACLs). This allows you to copy files you might otherwise not have access to, assuming it's being run under an account with sufficient privileges.
/zb	Copies files in restartable mode. If file access is denied, switches to backup mode.
/j	Copies using unbuffered I/O (recommended for large files).
/efsraw	Copies all encrypted files in EFS RAW mode.
/copy:<copyflags>	Specifies which file properties to copy. The valid values for this option are:
D - Data
A - Attributes
T - Time stamps
S - NTFS access control list (ACL)
O - Owner information
U - Auditing information
The default value for this option is DAT (data, attributes, and time stamps).
/dcopy:<copyflags>	Specifies what to copy in directories. The valid values for this option are:
D - Data
A - Attributes
T - Time stamps
The default value for this option is DA (data and attributes).
/sec	Copies files with security (equivalent to /copy:DATS).
/copyall	Copies all file information (equivalent to /copy:DATSOU).
/nocopy	Copies no file information (useful with /purge).
/secfix	Fixes file security on all files, even skipped ones.
/timfix	Fixes file times on all files, even skipped ones.
/purge	Deletes destination files and directories that no longer exist in the source. Using this option with the /e option and a destination directory, allows the destination directory security settings to not be overwritten.
/mir	Mirrors a directory tree (equivalent to /e plus /purge). Using this option with the /e option and a destination directory, overwrites the destination directory security settings.
/mov	Moves files, and deletes them from the source after they are copied.
/move	Moves files and directories, and deletes them from the source after they are copied.
/a+:[RASHCNET]	Adds the specified attributes to copied files. The valid values for this option are:
R - Read only
A - Archive
S - System
H - Hidden
C - Compressed
N - Not content indexed
E - Encrypted
T - Temporary
/a-:[RASHCNET]	Removes the specified attributes from copied files. The valid values for this option are:
R - Read only
A - Archive
S - System
H - Hidden
C - Compressed
N - Not content indexed
E - Encrypted
T - Temporary
/create	Creates a directory tree and zero-length files only.
/fat	Creates destination files by using 8.3 character-length FAT file names only.
/256	Turns off support for paths longer than 256 characters.
/mon:<n>	Monitors the source, and runs again when more than n changes are detected.
/mot:<m>	Monitors the source, and runs again in m minutes, if changes are detected.
/mt[:n]	Creates multi-threaded copies with n threads. n must be an integer between 1 and 128. The default value for n is 8. For better performance, redirect your output using /log option.
The /mt parameter can't be used with the /ipg and /efsraw parameters.

/rh:hhmm-hhmm	Specifies run times when new copies may be started.
/pf	Checks run times on a per-file (not per-pass) basis.
/ipg:n	Specifies the inter-packet gap to free bandwidth on slow lines.
/sj	Copies junctions (soft-links) to the destination path instead of link targets.
/sl	Don't follow symbolic links and instead create a copy of the link.
/nodcopy	Copies no directory info (the default /dcopy:DA is done).
/nooffload	Copies files without using the Windows Copy Offload mechanism.
/compress	Requests network compression during file transfer, if applicable.

F1 - Remove your Heads-Up Display 
Pressing F1 on your keyboard will remove your all of your on-screen displays. This includes the inventory slots at the bottom of your screen, and your hand. This is most useful for screenshots, or just for enjoying the view. 

F2 - Taking Screenshots 
Pressing F2 on your keyboard will take a screenshot of, well, your screen. They will be saved to your computer and can be accessed by doing this: 

Windows XP Or Higher: Go to the computer menu-thingy, and search "%appdata%. A file should pull up named "Roaming". Click it, click on .minecraft, and then click on screenshots. This will show you all the screenshots you have taken. 

Mac OS X: Go to your directory. Type in ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/screenshots 

Linux: Go to your directory. Type in ~/.minecraft/screenshots 

(I personally use a WIndows, so i'm not very experienced with Macs and such, so sorry if there's an error). 

F3 - Toggle The Debug Screen 
Pressing F3 on your keyboard will give you the debug screen. This will show you your coordinates, entity count, chunk updates, frames per second, available memory, and much more. 

Hold Shift before pressing F3 to display the Profiler graph. 

Pressing S while holding F3 will reload all web-loaded client resources, which is useful for resource pack authors. 

Pressing A while holding F3 will reload all chunks. 

Pressing T while holding F3 will reload all textures, which is useful for resource pack authors. 

Pressing P while holding F3 will toggle the auto-pause when the window loses focus. 

Pressing H while holding F3 will toggle detailed item descriptions (DIsplays durability on damaged tools and armor). 

Pressing C while holding F3 for at least 6 seconds will trigger a manual debug crash on purpose after the keys are released. 

Pressing B while holding F3 will toggle a hitbox around entities (Projectiles such as arrows), mobs, and players (Useful for PVP). 

Pressing D while holding F3 will clear chat history (including previously typed commands). 

F4 - Disable Shaders 
Pressing F4 on your keyboard will disable any in-game shaders you are using, and activate the original shader. You can activate shaders as of 1.7 by going into your options and clicking "Super Secret Settings" (Beware of loud noises). 

F5 - Change Your Perspective 
Pressing F5 on your keyboard will change what perspective your camera is on. 
First-Person - Default perspective, you are looking from the character's eyes. 
Third-Person (Front) - WIll change your perspective to look at the back of your head, and the surrounding area. 
Third-Person (Back) - WIll change your perspective to look at your face, and the surrounding area. 

F6 - Toggle Streaming 
If you have migrated your Minecraft account into a Mojang account you can press F6 stream using Twitch. If you are streaming, you will see a red dot in the top-right corner of your screen. 

F7 - Toggle Pause In Stream 
Pressing F7 on your keyboard will simply pause the stream. 

F11 - Toggle Fullscreen Mode 
I don't know too much about this one, so there may be false information. If you press F11, you will be in fullscreen mode. 
If you press ALT + TAB, you will exit out of fullscreen mode (i think). 

Shift Key - 
When the inventory is open, Shift + clicking on an item or stack moves it between the inventory and the hotbar. 
When a chest is open, Shift + clicking on an item will move the entire stack between the chest and the inventory. If you Shift + double click you can move all = items. 

When a furnace is open, Shift + clicking an item or stack in the furnace moves it to the inventory, and Shift + clicking an item or stack in the inventory moves it into the "item" (not fuel) slot of the furnace. 

When crafting, Shift + clicking the crafted item automatically crafts the maximum number of that item for the materials being used, and moves all crafted items to the inventory. 

In the survival inventory tab of the creative inventory, Shift + left click on the red 'Delete' field clears the whole inventory. 

When in the Multiplayer server selection menu, Shift + up and Shift + down moves a server name to a specific position. You can also hold shift while a server name is selected left click another server name and they will swap.

Tab - Show Players on Server 
Pressing the tab key (above caps lock) will show you the players on the server you're on. In some plugins, in-game ranks may be displayed in a different color. 

Q - Drop Items 
Instead of dragging items out of your inventory using your mouse, you can quickly get rid of items using Q. 
To drop items in your hotbar, select the item and press Q. In your inventory, holding CTRL while pressing Q will get rid of the whole stack of items. 

Left Control - Sprint 
If you holding Left Control while walking, you immediately go into sprint (It's not toggled ; you must hold it). 
This is a great alternative to double-tapping W, but I switched it to the R key because I always have my pinky finger on Shift, and find it hard to manevuer (even though they're right next to eachother). 

Alright, that's about everything you need to know to be a Minecraft Keyboard Expert! 
I probably missed a few things, so this information may not be exact. 
I know this definitely works for WIndows, but i'm not sure about the others.

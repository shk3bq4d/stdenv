‚Äúsearch term‚Äù
Force an exact-match search. Use this to refine results for ambiguous searches, or to exclude synonyms when searching for single words.

Example: ‚Äústeve jobs‚Äù

# OR
Search for X or Y. This will return results related to X or Y, or both. Note: The pipe (|) operator can also be used in place of ‚ÄúOR.‚Äù

Examples: jobs OR gates / jobs | gates

# AND
Search for X and Y. This will return only results related to both X and Y. Note: It doesn‚Äôt really make much difference for regular searches, as Google defaults to ‚ÄúAND‚Äù anyway. But it‚Äôs very useful when paired with other operators.

Example: jobs AND gates

# -
Exclude a term or phrase. In our example, any pages returned will be related to jobs but not Apple (the company).

Example: jobs ‚Äëapple

# *
Acts as a wildcard and will match any word or phrase.

Example: steve * apple

# ( )
Group multiple terms or search operators to control how the search is executed.

Example: (ipad OR iphone) apple

Here are the ones that are hit and miss, according to my testing:

Here are the Google search operators that have been discontinued and no longer work. üôÅ

SIDENOTE. You can do the same thing by using double quotes around your search.
~

inposttitle:
Find blog posts with specific words in the title. No longer works, as this operator was unique to the discontinued Google blog search.

Find information about a specific page, including the most recent cache, similar pages, etc. (Deprecated in 2017). Note: The id: operator can also be used‚Äîthe results are identical.

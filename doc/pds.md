# Marc 2017 mid-year

## automation is key
Mid-year: 100% reached

## Operation Monitoring  (10%) – never be blind
GL streams: streams "python production scripts" and "python production scripts >= WARN" have been created
GL dashboard: F5 has been improved (I wasn't the one to create it, but I added three items based on extractors I fixed as they were buggy)
GL extractor: wrote the ones for "python production scripts" and corrected some of F5
Zabbix: I harass my colleagues when they don't create maintenance window and operate on servers and am often also the first one to pick problems on the dashboard (my desk position relative to the big screen in the openspace helps a lot in this regard, though)

## Respect the DoD (Definition of Done) (10%) – git r' dun!
so far, so good

## Kanban (5%) – keep your team in the clear
- good communication. I can't wait if number of Jira comments show up somewhere in the KPI.
- team's life: have my team-mates smile often enough :)

## Team dev coherencies
Doing my best but is kinda hard when we're not a dev team. Result is OK anyhow.
Luckily for me, Bruno joined the team I can try to make his dev coherent with mine :)

## app stack proficiently
- wrote a zabbix webcheck no later than today
- created a temporary graylog alert no later than yesterday
- often help my teammates on git
- even taught stuff on katello to our two gurus

## Development skills - spread the knowledge
Not too bad for the moment. Working especially with Samba, Hai and Bruno on their respective dev

## Strengths
Strengths are great are constantly increasing => No remarks

## Development plan
So far so good, let's keep up with the current plan.

# Marc 2017
* Path to SRE (20%) – automation is key
- Comfortable with one language: 1 script/month to automate a task (preferably not a copy-paste from the internet)
- Comfortable with git: has to be in the commiter list 1/month (aligned on scripts)
 
* Operation Monitoring  (10%) – never be blind
- Graylog: Define stream and create dashboard for a particular area of choice
- Graylog: Write at least one grok extractor to have useful metadata on subject of choice
- Zabbix: Think about maintenance mode, and keep on eye on the dashboard to resolve issues before they become a problem.
 
* Respect the DoD (Definition of Done) (10%) – git r' dun!
- as published in the wiki
 
* Kanban (5%) – keep your team in the clear
- Describe precisely and accuretely tasks, and follow-up on issues created in our tool of choice (i.e. gitlab/jira)
	- Keep the kanban current and actual for team members
	 
* Agile rituals participation (5%) – the masked cucumbers.
- Team's life participation / mood


Development skills - spread the knowledge
- Ensure the team gets a >1 benefit from Marc's contribution from his help empowering his teammates. It is understood that Marc is good at what he's doing, however, alone, he can't produce more than one more work unit except if he helps his colleagues improving.
- Ensure the team is able to modify/reuse/improve Marc's developement deliveries should there be any need
- Help individuals in the team to be more proud on confident on their own scripts/programs even though learning is a humbling task

* **30 exceeded** Ramp-up and become expert at puppet.
  **Comment**:    Demonstrated a strong ability to pick things up on his own and deliver good results, quickly diving under the hoods to get stuff done. More to do, but amazing results so far (I would not expect any less :))  
* **20 met**      Lead the team in terms of custom integration work requiring coding (i.e. java or python). Expecting some coaching when necessary.
  **Comment**:    Already delivered on critical integration aspect, and is also spending times with colleagues to provide tips and guidance.  
* **20 exceeded** Support the development team to bridge between pure development and pure infrastructure tasks, such as specific monitoring scripts (i.e Zabbix), integration with Service Now and/or Managed Devices (as projects require).
  **Comment**:    Goes the extra mile.
* **10 met**      Become intimate with Openstack and S3 usage and APIs to leverage the group's private cloud capabilities.

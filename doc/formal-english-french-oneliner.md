## polite no
Hi!

Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible. It sincerely means a lot to us that you've taken time to contribute.

We don't want this to seem confrontational, but unfortunately we're not sure if we want this feature in the program. This issue has remained open for quite a while, and it has failed to garner any interest nor have any community members picked it up to work on it. However, we're absolutely always up for discussion. Since this is a really busy project, we don't always see comments on closed tickets, but want to encourage open dialog. You can stop by the development list, and we'd be glad to talk about it - and we might even be persuaded otherwise!

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel
In the future, sometimes starting a discussion on the development list prior to implenting a feature can make getting things included a little easier, but it's not always necessary.

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!

1) to the annoying guy: ook, I understand that the teams are participating in this, but I don't feel comfortable, so I am not. Please let this matter drop, the rest of the team has.
2) to the annoying guy: Look, we've already discussed this and I am not participating. If we need to get your supervisor involved, we can, but I would prefer not to.
3) to the guy's manager: Hi, I'm sorry to bother you with what might seem a petty matter, but I've had several conversations with Joe about letting the matter with the curse jar drop, and he won't. This is making me a bit uncomfortable, could you please talk to him?

# double standard over sexist comment from men -> women

A male boss saying "darling" to a female employee
The statements made by your male boss is a typical first step of a courtship ritual for a man. Any woman who has been the target of unwanted attention a couple of times will recognize it. It may look perfectly civilized on the surface, and it probably feels this way to the boss too. It is still a signal that the boss would very much like to create more intimacy. Even if he does not plan to act on that desire, it is still extremely uncomfortable for the targeted woman. It legitimately creeps her out.

A very devious thing here is that men tend to overestimate the reciprocity of attraction. If he sends a mild signal of attraction and the woman does not immediately act with aversion but simply takes it with embarrassed silence, he sees this as acceptance enough to press a bit more if the situation presents itself. If the woman is too shy to openly rebuff him for whatever reason, this creates a very awkward situation. And the fewest people are brave enough to openly confront their boss, especially when it comes to personal matters.

Woman -> man sexual harassment
Now you are asking, what about the reverse situation? Well, if we have a woman boss signalling her sexual attraction to a male employee, then you are correct. This is as much of a sexism issue as the other way around. Maybe men are wired in a way that they are less likely to perceive attention from a woman as unwanted, but it still can happen. And when it happens, they are entitled to be taken seriously, and to receive support in dealing with it.

A female boss calling a male employee "darling"
Statements like "you have nice hair" or calling someone "darling" are not connected to sexual attraction for women the way they are for men. Women frequently use them with people to whom they are not attracted, and rarely make them part of their courtship ritual. While they are statements whose relationship aspect dominates their factual information aspect, they do not establish an admirer/pursued relationship when used by women. Conversely, you will not hear a straight man calling their male employee "darling", because that would imply such a relationship. Human language is complex like that.

It is difficult to define what statements made by a woman would be equivalent to those made by your male boss. This is because women tend to use more nonverbal behavior at the early steps of the courtship ritual. If you were to notice that your female boss is wearing lipstick only on days when she has a meeting scheduled with you, this would be a comparable signal to a man's "you have nice hair".

Is this an example of double standard?
I am not denying that a double standard exists, with men having it hard to convince people that they can be the target of sexism. But the situation you describe is not an example of the double standard. It is a sensible policy which does take into account the intricacies of human communication. The words uttered may be the same, but the real signal behind them is quite different.

The fine print - please read if you disagree with the above
To preempt critics, because it's a rather sensitive topic: please do not try to draw too broad generalizations from this post. I am perfectly aware that there are courtship behaviors which men and women have in common. A woman patting a man's bum is just as inappropriate as a man patting a woman's bum. The post focuses on the exact kind of statement noted in the question.

Also, I am aware that there are individual differences. There can be women who send early verbal signals of attraction, or men who manage to use "darling" without being sleazy. Still, the answer above covers the average situation pretty well. The policy exists to establish the standard operation procedure for the average situation, but in the individual case, it matters whether the target is creeped out or not.

I am also sure that I will get comments saying that the differences I described above shouldn't exist, are not natural, describe a patriarchal norm, etc. A debate over nature vs. nurture would be irrelevant here. Fact is, we are living in a world in which the difference exists. Targets of sexual harassment should be given support based on the reality they live in and not on "if women behaved exactly as men and reacted to external stimuli exactly as men, the world would be simpler and we'd have real equality".

Another topic I didn't touch on is that same-gender harassment also exists, that transgender harassment is different from harassment between cisgendered people, etc. I kept the answer heteronormative, because it is complex enough without me addressing issues with which I have little experience and which are not relevant for the concrete situation experienced by the OP.

## How to create a quality ticket/issue
Whenever you request help from DevOps, the engineers expect some information to be given as to efficiently work on the issue without spending most of the time hunting for information.

Therefore, we've put some guideline together in order to help you create a great ticket ￼

Use the "Service Request" type for most of your requests, unless you know you should do otherwise.

We can always requalify them.

The "Change" type is reserved for DevOps teams. If a change is required, it'll be prepared by DevOps and you will be kept informed.

Take the few minutes needed to fill out the description with proper English (or French possibly), with as much details as possible. These minutes will likely make everyone save possible hours down the line.

1 problem == 1 ticket
If you need help on several issues, please open different tickets.
Do not hijack tickets, meaning, do not use an existing ticket to talk about another issue just because it looks easier for you.
Provide context around your issue
What environment are in?
Production? staging? Mention it to us if you don't know.
What user are you using to perform your action?
Are you trying from home or from the office?
Let us know your external IP address if you think that can help.
Has anyone else helped you?
Beware of the difference between Nagra environments and our own KS environments. We know it can be confusing and it's happened before.
If you've done several tests of your own, please mention it
If you've tried to resolve your issue on your own first, we truly appreciate it! ￼
Please let us know what exactly that you tried
Provide an exact error message?
A screenshot is nice to express something. Make sure you capture everything that is relevant in that screenshot
The URL is always good
The windows border will point us to the fact that you may be using a Linux O/S, Windows or Mac, which may help.
Provide logs if available.
Example, your vpn client logs
If you're hunting down a problem with a server, please provide some server logs that pertains to the issue.

If you open an issue with us, you need to follow-up.
We expect timely response when troubleshooting a ticket for you.
If there is no response, we may close your ticket.
We'll try to be nice, so should you.
That sounds odd, I know.
Keep in mind we're an engineering team and true helpdesk is not our forte.
However, be sure that we will always try our best to help you, just as we expect you to help us in giving us the right info at the right time.

If we feel an issue is raised without respecting guidelines, it may be closed without further due and you may need to reopen another one, with the proper information.

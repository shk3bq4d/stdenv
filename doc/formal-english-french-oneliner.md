# email consultant français
Bonjour,

Je vous remercie pour votre email et de l'intérêt que vous prêter à mon profil.

Malheureusement, je ne suis pas en écoute active du marché en ce moment et ne souhaite donc pas donner suite à cette possibilité.

Soyez assuré que je me permettrai de vous recontacter lorsque mes prédispositions auront évoluées.

En vous priant de croire à l'expression de mes sentiments les plus sincères, je vous souhaite bonne suite dans vos recherches ainsi qu'une excellente journée.

Cordialement,

# email consultant français, suite connaissez-vous quelqu'un

1) to the annoying guy: ook, I understand that the teams are participating in this, but I don't feel comfortable, so I am not. Please let this matter drop, the rest of the team has.
2) to the annoying guy: Look, we've already discussed this and I am not participating. If we need to get your supervisor involved, we can, but I would prefer not to.
3) to the guy's manager: Hi, I'm sorry to bother you with what might seem a petty matter, but I've had several conversations with Joe about letting the matter with the curse jar drop, and he won't. This is making me a bit uncomfortable, could you please talk to him?
